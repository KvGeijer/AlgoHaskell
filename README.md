# AlgoHaskell
Some of my small projects while learning to code in Haskell. The problems are are mainly about trying to write efficient algorithms using Haskell, which was a great learning experience. But it also showed me a lot of the limitations with pure functional programming. The problems came from my course in algorithms and it was fun to compare these solutions with my other ones written in imperative languages like Java.
