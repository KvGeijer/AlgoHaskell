# AlgoHaskell
Some of my small projects while learning to code in Haskell. The problems are are mainly about trying to write efficient algorithms using Haskell, which was a great learning experience. But it also showed me a lot of the limitations with functional programming. I tried to not include anything here which could be copied to solve labs in courses.
